## Comparative Stock Analysis Volume - II

 ###Introduction
   
   If you are interested in intra day trading or you want to know or identify patterns in stock market, this article is for you. In last 
   Descriptive analysis was provided for comparative analysis on stocks. In this post, emphasis is given on identifying patterns
   in order to know how a stock behaves which is very important for stock trading. Later part of the article will show how to predict
   stock prices using "forecast" package using the conventional ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Intensive Moving Average Method) methodolgy from 
   Time Series Analysis.
   
   ### Setting up the System
   
       ####Required Packages

           * Quandl             Data Download
           * timetk             To coerce the dataframe into xts
           * tidyverse          Use of tibble to group and perform single operation on multiple groups
           * tidyquant          Time Series and Financial functions to perform the analysis
           * forecast           Time Series Analysis
           * stringr            For string use  

        ### Getting Started with Comparative Analysis of Stocks Vol-II
       
          #### Bollinger Band
            
            The Bollinger Band was introduce by John Bollinger in 1980s, the Band shows the volatility of stock. Volatility is based
            on standard deviation, which changes as volatility increases or decreases. The Volatility bands are placed above and below
            the moving average line. The wider the gap between the bands, higher is the degree of volatility. On the other hand, as the 
            wideness within the band decreases, lower is the degree of volatility of the stock. At times, the wideness within the band is
            constant over a period of time, which shows the constant behaviour of a certain stock over the period of time.
            
            There are three lines in the  Bollinger Band,
            
            Bollinger Bands consist of:

             * The middle line with N-period moving average (MA);
                20-day SMA 
             
             * An upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the moving average;
               20-day SMA + (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)  
               
             * A lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the moving average;
                20-day SMA - (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)
                
             Note: SMA is Simple Moving Average, K and N period is ususally set at 20 days. Standard deviation is taken for 20 days.
                   The upper and lower band are placed 2 units above and below respectively.
                   
             Below image is the typical example for Bollinger Band. This shows the volatility of Axis Bank stock for the period of
             1 year from 1st Spetember, 2016 to 1st September, 2017. The gap was higher in the months of September till December.

   #### Trading with Bollinger Bands
   
       In this section, we will discuss few aspects of Bollinger Band. This information can be used in different stock trading.
       
        * If an uptrend is strong, then stock touches the upper band on regular basis and remain above the middle line.
          This signals the strong movement towards North.
        * If downtrend is strong, then stong touches the lower band on regular basis and remain below the middle line. This
          signals strong southward movement.
        * During the upward trend the price should not be below the lower band otherwise its signalling the reverse movement.
        * During the downward trend, if the price move above the upper band then it signals Northward movement.
        
    The study will discuss the above points along with the identification of popular patterns like "W - Bottoms" & "M - Tops" in
    bollinger band.
    
    ### Keep it Clean!
        
        We will keep the data clean with tidyverse. In this section we will first download the data with the help of Quandl package
        and then manipulate the dataframe with tidyverse to get our desired dataset,
     
     
```{r,eval=FALSE}
## Required Packages
library(Quandl)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(timetk)
library(forecast)
library(gridExtra)
```

#### Code Break up for Quandl and Quandl API key,

Please read my previous post on [Comparative Stock Analysis Vol - I](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/comparative-stock-analysis/)

```{r,eval=FALSE}
## Setup the Quandl Free Acount and API Key, Please copy and paste the API key in order to #authinticate

Quandl.api_key("xRPW5yp-5pmJCQZqgNVN")

## Download the data Set
ICICI = Quandl("NSE/ICICIBANK",collapse="daily",start_date="2016-09-01",type="raw")

## Paste the stock name in stock coloumn

ICICI$Stock<-paste(ICICI$Stock,"ICICI",sep="")
PNB$Stock<-paste(PNB$Stock,"PNB",sep="")
Axis$Stock<-paste(Axis$Stock,"Axis",sep="")
SBI$Stock<-paste(SBI$Stock,"SBI",sep="")
Canara$Stock<-paste(Canara$Stock,"Canara",sep="")
BOB$Stock<-paste(BOB$Stock,"BOB",sep="")

## Consolidate under one dataset

Master_Data<-rbind(ICICI,PNB,Axis,SBI,Canara,BOB)  

## Coerce the Date variable into as.Date from character

Master_Data$Date<-as.Date(Master_Data$Date)

end<-ymd("2017-09-01")
start<-ymd("2016-09-01")

Master_Data<-Master_Data%>%
  tibble::as_tibble() %>%
group_by(Stock)
```

### Identification of Patterns
 
    #### Signal W - Bottoms
    
         A “W-Bottom” forms in a downtrend and involves two reaction lows. 
         In particular, Bollinger looks for W-Bottoms where the second low is lower than the first but holds above the lower band.
         There are four steps to confirm Bollinger "W - Bottoms",
         
         *  First, a reaction low forms. This low is usually,below the lower band (Not Always).
         *  Secondly, there is a bounce towards the middle band.
         *  Thirdly, there is a new price low in the security. This low holds above the lower band.
         *  Fourth, the pattern is confirmed with a strong move off the second low and a resistance break.
         
         Below image is the "W-Bottoms" identification for BOB (Bank of Baroda). Both of the W-Bottoms are followed by strong 
         northward move in february and May, 2017 respectively.
         
<img src="https://github.com/richie312/Comparative-Stock-Analysis/blob/master/W-Bottom_BOB.png" width="400" height="300">

     #### Signal: M-Tops
     
           An M-Top is similar to a double top. M-Tops are reversal signals from upward trend into a downward trend.
           The first high can be higher or lower than the second high. Initially there is a wave higher, which gets close to or
           move above the upper band. Then price will move downward to middle band and then continues northward journey, might or might
           not touch the upper band (at times it goes above the previous high) and then does not close above the upper band.
       
           Bollinger suggests looking for signs of non-confirmation when a security is making new highs.A non-confirmation occurs 
           with three steps. 
           
            * First, a security creates a reaction high above the upper band. 
            * Second, there is a pullback towards the middle band. 
            * Third, prices move above the prior high but fail to reach the upper band. This is a warning sign. 
              The inability of the second reaction high to reach the upper band shows waning momentum, which can foreshadow a 
              trend reversal. Final confirmation comes with a support break or bearish indicator signal. 
         
         Below is the image for MTOPS signal for SBI (State Bank Of India) stock in NSE over the period of one year starting from
         1st sept, 2016 to 1st sept, 2017. Each of the MTops are followed by decline in prices in the months of Nov-Dec, May and August.

   Prices were ranging from Rs 470 to Rs 520 for the later part of the year. Here it was almost
   constant and seems to converge.

1. Both the Stocks BOB and Canara shows similar price movement through out the year.
   both of them declined from oct 2016 to mid of Jan 2017 and then shown improvement
   till April. But After April both the stocks were on opposite directions. Canara went
   northwards, where as BOB went southward.

2. BOB shows W Bottoms in Jan 2017 and April followed with strong upward movement.
