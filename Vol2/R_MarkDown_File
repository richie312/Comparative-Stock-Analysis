## Comparative Stock Analysis Volume - II

 ###Introduction
   If you are interested in intra trading or you want to know or identify patterns in stock market, this article is for you. In last 
   post, Descriptive analysis was provided for comparative analysis on stocks. In this post, emphasis is given on identifying patterns
   in order to know how a stock behaves which is very important for stock trading. Later part of the article will show how to predict
   stock prices using "forecast" package using the conventional ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Intensive Moving Average Method) methodolgy from 
   Time Series Analysis.
   
   #### Identifying Patterns
       
       #### Bollinger Band
            
            The Bollinger Band was introduce by John Bollinger in 1980s, the Band shows the volatility of stock. Volatility is based
            on standard deviation, which changes as volatility increases or decreases. The Volatility bands are placed above and below
            the moving average line. The wider the gap between the bands, higher is the degree of volatility. On the other hand, as the 
            wideness within the band decreases, lower is the degree of volatility of the stock. At times, the wideness within the band is
            constant over a period of time, which shows the constant behaviour of a certain stock over the period of time.
            
            There are three lines in the  Bollinger Band,
            
            Bollinger Bands consist of:

             * The middle line with N-period moving average (MA);
                20-day SMA 
             
             * An upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the moving average;
               20-day SMA + (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)  
               
             * A lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the moving average;
                20-day SMA - (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)
                
             Note: SMA is Simple Moving Average, K and N period is ususally set at 20 days. Standard deviation is taken for 20 days.
                   The upper and lower band are placed 2 units above and below respectively.
                   
             Below image is the typical example for Bollinger Band. This shows the volatility of Axis Bank stock for the period of
             1 year from 1st Spetember, 2016 to 1st September, 2017. The gap was higher in the months of September till December.
